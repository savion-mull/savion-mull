##  ***Financial Research | Economics & Computer Science***

Hey, my name is Savion, a Computer Science student at Century College pursuing a A.S. in Computer Science, and a transfer into a dual major; **BS in Computer Science & Economics** at a university. My github is a reflection of my self-directed work, and focuses on the intersection of financial analysis, data-driven decision-making, and quantitative research. My goal is to develop a problem-solving foundation across financial modeling, and computational research to apply to valuation, capital markets, and systematic trading.

Disclaimer: This github repo serves as a public learning ledger and research portfolio, to document both my development and research in financial modeling and analysis, AI/ML, and programming.
